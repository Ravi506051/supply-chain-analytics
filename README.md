# Supply Chain Analytics

Inventory and supply-chain analytics for stock health, supplier lead times, and reorder planning.

## Overview
This repository contains an independently authored, reproducible Python application. It is designed as a portfolio-quality demonstration of a practical analytics or machine-learning workflow, with interactive exploration and downloadable results.

## Features
- Interactive Streamlit interface
- Reproducible demo data so the project runs immediately
- Data exploration, modelling or KPI analysis relevant to the project
- Charts and tabular results
- CSV export where applicable

## Tech stack
Python, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Plotly.

## Run locally
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Data and reproducibility
The default dataset is synthetic and generated in code with a fixed random seed. It is intended for demonstration and testing, not as a substitute for validated real-world data. Where applicable, upload a CSV through the app to explore your own dataset.

## Responsible use
Outputs are educational and should not be treated as professional, medical, financial, credit, or hiring decisions. Validate data quality, model performance, fairness, privacy, and domain requirements before any real-world use.

## Originality and attribution
The implementation in this repository is newly authored for this portfolio and is not a wholesale copy of another GitHub repository. Public open-source project directories and topic pages were consulted for project discovery and inspiration; no third-party source code is being represented as original work.

## License

## Operational Validation

- Define inventory, lead-time, stockout, and reorder metrics consistently across suppliers and products.
- Validate date ranges, units, missing deliveries, and unusually large or negative quantities.
- Compare suggested reorder quantities with lead-time assumptions and safety-stock policies.
- Treat analytical recommendations as planning support and confirm operational constraints before acting.
